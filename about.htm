                <p>Chatsworth Centre is undoubtedly part of the rich and diverse fabric of Chatsworth, playing an active and productive role in the community. With our finger firmly on the pulse of our market, the centre has established a reputation of knowing how to service the needs and wants of our target market. The centre turned 30 in 2019 and still continues to perform exceptionally well.

                The Centre is situated on a hilly terrain +/- 15 km from the Durban CBD and is bordered by the Umlaas River in the South and the Umhlatuzana River in the North. Access to the centre is via the Higginson Highway and within walking distance of the major bus routes and railway station. </p>
